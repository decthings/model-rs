## Decthings model using Rust

[![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/decthings-model)](https://crates.io/crates/decthings-model)
[![docs.rs](https://img.shields.io/docsrs/decthings-model)](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/decthings-model/)

Use Rust to create a Decthings model.

### Setup

Create a Decthings model using Rust by going to the [create model page](https://app.decthings.com/models/create) on Decthings, and select Rust as the language. This package is then by default installed and used within your model.

This package works for both WASM and non-wasm models.

Manually, you can install this package using `cargo add decthings-model`.

### Execute a model

In case you want to run a Decthings model on your own system you can use the Rust crate [decthings-model-executor](https://github.com/decthings/model-executor).
